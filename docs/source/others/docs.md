Summary Documentation Organization
==================================

1) User Manual (Wiki - github/sphinx/...)

	Note: git clone git@github.com:Tsur/kalzate.wiki.git (Now you can work straight out with the wiki)

	1.1) Intro (Readme.md)
	1.2) Getting Starter
	1.3) Users
	1.4) Store
	1.5) Tickets
	1.6) Contributing (Reporting bugs)
	1.7) FAQ

2) Technical Docs(JSDoc)

	2.1) Intro (Readme.md)
	2.2) For Developers
	2.3) For Sys Admins (CentOS)
	2.4) For QA

	Documentation is auto-generated by JSDoc. We made the choice on it for the next advantages:

		* support for code-related (not in code) documentation
		* markdown and readme easy integration
		* themes

	others: Yuidocs, smartcomments, grunt-docular, ... etc

3) Team Management

	Private documentation related to company organization, team management, agile methodologies implemented, strategies, ... etc should not be tracked by a public repository since they only regard for private company concerns, so them all should be kept save in a private docs storage service as dropbox, google docs, ... etc


4) Local Storage Devices (Flash USB Memory, External HD)

	All sensitive information as RSA keys, passwords, ... etc

Javascript Code Conventions (Maintainable JavaScript)
=====================================================

Maintainable JavaScript tackles the difficult problem of writing code as part of a large team. When you're writing code that only you will change, there aren't any issues. As soon as you're writing code that someone else is going to also be changing, you need to think harder about the decisions you make. Will another developer be able to understand what you did? Did you organize your code in such a way that it's easy to adapt and extend? Long after you're gone, will others be able to continue using the same code, or will it need to be rewritten because no one understands it? To make it works fine, read below.

1) Style Guide: Ensure everyone's speaking the same language

	All developers should follow the same conventions when coding. This project uses google style guide for javascript (https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)

2) Programming Practices: Common patterns for common problems which allow for easier code changes and debugging

3) Automation of Code tasks: make easier to perform complex multi-step tasks.
